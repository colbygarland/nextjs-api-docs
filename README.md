# NextJS Api Docs

This is a simple website for viewing your internal API documentation. 

## API Documentation

It is all run off of the `docs/docs.json` file. You can create your models and your endpoints and the website will build for you based on that.

## Request / Response body

Under the `docs/` folder, you can set how your request and response will look like.
